# _'From scratch to online in production'_ in a single day, with Django - Part 2

## Quick summary of the previous part

In [part 1](/2022/07-19---from-scratch-to-online-in-production-in-a-single-day-with-django-part-1) we saw
a way to set up a Django project in a quite generic way, that can be used for _any_ kind of project:

 - Dependencies are managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
 - Settings that differ from an environment to another come from environment variables, and are populated from
      optional `.env` files in "local development" mode, powered by [django-environ](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  
      ``` python
      SECRET_KEY = env.str("SECRET_KEY")
   
      DATABASES = {
          "default": env.db_url("DATABASE_URL"),
      }
      ```
      On top of this we also have a Python module for each type of environment - so we'll use 
      the [DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/settings/#designating-the-settings) environment variable 
      to point to `project.settings.development` during  local development , `project.settings.heroku` on Heroku, 
      `project.settings.test` when running our test suite, etc.

!!! info
    Having such multiple settings files is a best practice I learned by reading
    the great book _[Two Scoops of Django](https://www.feldroy.com/books/two-scoops-of-django-3-x)_ - which itself 
    cites [this talk](https://www.slideshare.net/jacobian/the-best-and-worst-of-django) from  Jacob Kaplan-Moss.
      
 - A `src/` folder contains all the application code, within 2 top-level packages for our Python modules:
     * `project`, which contains the Django settings and the WSGI/ASGI HTTP entrypoints
     * `apps` for the Django apps - so each of them is free to have any name we want, without any risks of collisions
    with an existing 3rd-party package.

## Next step: we have to organise the business logic inside our Django apps

Django has some built-in recommendations about how to structure a project.  
Its [applications](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/applications/) concept for example is a good start to split the code into smaller units, 
and some basic rules like this one are good guidelines:

!!! quote
    If there are 20+ models in a single app, think about ways to break it down into smaller apps,
    as it probably means your app is doing too much.  
    In practice, we like to lower this number to **no more than five to ten models per app**.
    
    _From [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.feldroy.com/books/two-scoops-of-django-3-x)_


Now, let's take a look at an aspect that may be a mystery for other developers who enter this new ecosystem they're not
familiar with yet - like me a few years ago, when I switched from _"PHP + Symfony :elephant:"_ to _"Python + Django :snake:"_ : 
> How to organise the business logic **inside** each Django app?
> 
> _Me, as I was learning Django_ :sweat_smile:

Well, I guess _"the Django way"_ would probably be to follow [the Active Record pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)
and write most of the code for this in the Models themselves - as well as in their 
[Managers](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/managers/) 
_(which are similar to "repositories" or "entity managers" when using the Data Mapper pattern)_

However, in my own (subjective) case I generally find that doing so doesn't scale very well as the project grows, 
as we end up having all the business logic grouped in a bunch of huge classes.  
Which is why, as I was learning Django, I was quite eager to find another way to structure my code... :thinking:

## An efficient pattern for the business logic: simplicity that scales well :ok_hand:

When I started to learn Django I was lucky enough to stumble upon this [Django Styleguide](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide),
published on GitHub by the software development company HackSoft.  
And more specifically this part, where they explain "services" and "selectors":

 - https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide#services

#### My own adaptation of the "services" and "selectors" concept from HackSoft

As I'm mostly working with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) in my day-to-day job, I opted for a terminology that rings a bell a bit more to my ears 
than _"services"_ and _"selectors"_: `mutations` and `queries`.  
The former is a package that contains code that _alter_ a database (adding, modifying or deleting data from it), while the
latter is specialised in _fetching_ data.

Here is how it looks like applied to my "Gin Rummy leaderboard" mini project:  
_(the parts of the tree that don't matter in this case are replaced with three dots)_

```

1. In this package we have the code that _alters_ data
2. In this package we have the code that _fetches_ data
3. `asgi.py`, `urls.py` and `wsgi.py` were created by the [startproject](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/django-admin/#startproject)
    command.  
    `jinja2.py` is where I quickly configure Jinja, following the Django documentation:  
    > https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/templates/#django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2

We can see that for each Django app we have 2 sub-packages:

 - `domain.mutations` is where the code that _alter_ data lives
 - `domain.queries` is where the code that _fetch_ data lives

They're both structured the same way, following these principles from HackSoft's styleguide:

 - Each of their module **exposes only one public function** - and optionally some types if it has to,
    in order to describe the shape of its input and/or output.
 - Each of these one-per-module-functions only accepts keyword arguments.
 - These functions' signatures should be fully "type hinted".
 - Each module is free to use as many private functions it needs to achieve the job described by its single
    public function.
 - For the mutations, these functions' name should start with _a verb_, since they're the reflection of a business logic _action_
 - Each module's name is prefixed with an underscore, to emphasise that it should not be imported directly
 - The `__init__.py` file is in charge of exposing the public function of each module to the "outside world" - i.e. the Python
    code that doesn't live in the same package.

!!! info 
    The goal of the last 2 points is to avoid this kind of imports, where we have to repeat
    the same name twice - once of the module name and once for the function itself:
    ``` python
    from .domain.mutations.save_game_result import save_game_result
    ```
    So instead of this repetition we can simply do:
    ``` python
    from .domain.mutations import save_game_result
    ```

## A concrete example, with the Gin Rummy leaderboard app

Ok, enough theory - let's see how that works in the context of this mini project! :slight_smile:

We have a single [Django model](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/models/), that looks like this: 
``` python
class GameResult(models.Model):
   player_north_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
   player_south_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
   outcome = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[(outcome, outcome) for outcome in GAME_OUTCOME.__args__])  # type: ignore
   # These 2 ones can be `null` when the outcome is `draw`:
   winner_name = models.CharField(max_length=50, null=True)
   deadwood_value = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(null=True)
   # Computed from the previous `outcome` and `deadwood_value` fields:
   winner_score = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(null=True)
   
   created_at = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
   
   @property
   def is_draw(self) -> bool:
       return self.outcome == "draw"
   
   @cached_property
   def loser_name(self) -> str | None:
       if self.is_draw:
          return None
       return [name for name in (self.player_north_name, self.player_south_name) if name != self.winner_name][0]
   
   def __str__(self) -> str:
       return f"{self.player_north_name.title()} vs {self.player_south_name.title()}, on {self.created_at.strftime('%a %d %b at %H:%M')}"
``` 

### The `domain.mutations` package of our Django app

For this minimalist project we need only one mutation, which is triggered when the user
submits the "New game result" HTML form:
``` python
# file: src/apps/gin_scoring/domain/_save_game_result.py
from ...domain.gin_rummy import GAME_OUTCOME, calculate_round_score
from ...models import GameResult


def save_game_result(
    *, # (1)
    player_north_name: str,
    player_south_name: str,
    outcome: GAME_OUTCOME, # (2)
    winner_name: str | None,
    deadwood_value: int,
) -> GameResult:
    is_draw = outcome == "draw"

    winner_score = None
    if is_draw:
        winner_name = None
    else:
        winner_score = calculate_round_score(game_outcome=outcome, deadwood_value=deadwood_value)

    game_result_model = GameResult(
        # (3)
        player_north_name=player_north_name,
        player_south_name=player_south_name,
        outcome=outcome,
        winner_name=winner_name,
        deadwood_value=deadwood_value,
        winner_score=winner_score,
    )
    # (4)
    game_result_model.save()

    return game_result_model

```

1. We force this function to be used only with the "keyword arguments" syntax
2. `GAME_OUTCOME` is just a literal type, described later on in this same article :slight_smile:
3. To my knowledge there's no equivalent of the 
    [Shorthand property names of ES2015](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#new_notations_in_ecmascript_2015)
    in Python - which I guess must be on purpose, since readability is almost always the top priority of the language?    
    For that reason we have to repeat the `[field name]=[arg name]` pattern, but in my opinion it's not really an issue :slight_smile:
4. The model also has a `created_at` field, but it will automatically be set by the Django ORM
    since we've used `default=timezone.now` when we defined the `models.DateTimeField` field :slight_smile:


And then, we expose that function to the rest of the Python code:
``` python
# file: src/apps/gin_scoring/domain/mutations/__init__.py
from ._save_game_result import save_game_result
``` 

All we have to do now is to use that mutation from a Django view.  
There are several ways to do this, but here is an example:
``` python
# file: src/apps/gin_scoring/views.py
from .domain.mutations import save_game_result

# ...

@require_POST
def post_game_result(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    try:
        game_result_payload = GameResultPayload(**request.POST.dict())
    except pydantic.ValidationError:
        return HttpResponseBadRequest()

    save_game_result(
        # (1)
        player_north_name=game_result_payload.player_north_name,
        player_south_name=game_result_payload.player_south_name,
        outcome=game_result_payload.outcome,
        winner_name=game_result_payload.winner_name,
        deadwood_value=game_result_payload.deadwood_value,
    )

    return redirect("index")
``` 

1. Note that we could also have opted for a more concise way to transfer data from the "validation
    and normalisation" data structure to the mutation: :slight_smile:
    ``` python
    save_game_result( **game_result_payload.dict() )
    ```

!!! note "Validating the input of our Django views"
    There are multiple ways to **validate** and **normalise** the input of our Django views, before
    passing its data to the "domain" layer.  
    In this case I chose to use [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).
    ``` python
    # file: src/apps/gin_scoring/http_payloads.py
    from typing import Any
    
    import pydantic
    
    from .domain.gin_rummy import GAME_OUTCOME
    from .helpers import normalize_player_name
    
    
    class GameResultPayload(pydantic.BaseModel):
        player_north_name: str
        player_south_name: str
        outcome: GAME_OUTCOME
        winner_name: str | None
        deadwood_value: int
    
        @pydantic.root_validator(pre=True)
        def normalize_player_names(cls, values: dict[str, Any]):
            # In order to have consistent recording when players "Rachel" and "Olivier" add a game result, whether
            # "Rachel" is "north" and "Olivier" is "south" or vice-versa, we sort their names alphabetically
            # and then always set the "north" player to the first one and the "south" one to the second one:
            player_north_name, player_south_name = sorted(
                (
                    normalize_player_name(values["player_north_name"]),
                    normalize_player_name(values["player_south_name"]),
                )
            )
            values["player_north_name"] = player_north_name
            values["player_south_name"] = player_south_name
            return values
    
        @pydantic.validator("winner_name")
        def validate_winner_name(cls, v: str, values: dict[str, Any]) -> str | None:
            is_draw = values["outcome"] == "draw"
    
            if is_draw:
                return None  # No winner name for "draw" games
    
            if not v:
                raise ValueError(f"non-draw games must have a winner name")
            winner_name = normalize_player_name(v)
            player_names = (values["player_north_name"], values["player_south_name"])
            if winner_name not in player_names:
                raise ValueError(f"winner name {v} is not part of the players' names '{','.join(player_names)}'")
    
            return winner_name

    ``` 


### The `domain.queries` package of our Django app

For this simple app we need only 3 queries:

 - One to get the _global_ "Hall of fame", where we determine the ranking of players
    based on _all_ the games played so far
 - One to get the _monthly_ "Hall of fame", which does the same but with a distinct ranking
    _for each month_
 - One that returns exhaustive data for the last 10 games that were played

Let's take a look at the second one, for example:
``` python
# file: src/apps/gin_scoring/domain/queries/_hall_of_fame_monthly.py
from collections import defaultdict
from datetime import datetime
from typing import NamedTuple

from django.db.models import Count, Sum
from django.db.models.functions import TruncMonth

from ...models import GameResult  # (1)


class HallOfFameMonthResult(NamedTuple): # (2)
    month: datetime
    winner_name: str
    game_counts: int
    win_counts: int
    score_delta: int


def hall_of_fame_monthly() -> list[HallOfFameMonthResult]:
    # ⚠️ Probably not the very best way to achieve this...
    # But this is a project I gave myself one single day to build,
    # so that will do the job 😅
    
    # @link https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/aggregation/
    win_counts = Count("winner_score")
    total_score = Sum("winner_score")

    raw_results = (
        GameResult.objects.filter(winner_name__isnull=False)
        .annotate(month=TruncMonth("created_at")) # (3)
        .values("month", "winner_name")
        .distinct()
        .annotate(win_counts=win_counts, total_score=total_score)
        # Each won round is worth 25 points:
        .annotate(grand_total=(win_counts * 25) + total_score)
        .order_by("-month", "-grand_total")
    )
    raw_results_per_month: dict[datetime, list[dict]] = defaultdict(list)
    for raw_result in raw_results:
        raw_results_per_month[raw_result["month"]].append(raw_result)
        
    returned_results: list[HallOfFameMonthResult] = []
    for month, month_results in raw_results_per_month.items():
        winner_result = month_results[0]
        winner_grand_total = winner_result["grand_total"] or 0
        second_best_grand_total = 0 if len(month_results) < 2 else (month_results[1]["grand_total"] or 0)
        games_count = sum([res["win_counts"] for res in month_results])

        returned_results.append(
            HallOfFameMonthResult(
                month=month,
                winner_name=winner_result["winner_name"],
                game_counts=games_count,
                win_counts=winner_result["win_counts"],
                score_delta=winner_grand_total - second_best_grand_total,
            )
        )

    return returned_results

```
 
1. I like using _relative_ imports for things we import _that live in the same Django app_.  
    In all other cases I'd use _absolute_ imports. 
2. We're not returning ActiveRecord items directly from a Django QuerySet there,
    but aggregated results.  
    There are several data structures we can use in Python for that
    kind of "value objects", but I generally opt for [typing.NamedTuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple)
3. This is where we group the database rows by month
4. Yes, I could probably have used [itertools.groupby](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby) instead ^_^

!!! note
    Note that we could have split this into several functions - in which case
    they would all be private functions (their name would start with an underscore),
    and only the "domain" one would be public :slight_smile:

And similarly, the `__init__.py` file is in charge of exposing only what the rest of the Python
``` python
# file: src/apps/gin_scoring/domain/queries/__init__.py
from ._hall_of_fame import hall_of_fame
from ._hall_of_fame_monthly import (
    HallOfFameMonthResult, # (1)
    hall_of_fame_monthly
) 
from ._last_game_results import last_game_results # (2)

1. Sometimes it's useful to not only export the one public function of the module,
    but also a dedicated type it's using for its input or output - so other Python modules
    can also use type hints when interacting with the "domain" layer
2. But most of the time, all we need is to expose the public function of the module :smile:

### But what about the domain logic that is neither a mutation nor a query?

We still have to put somewhere some parts of the domain don't fall in either categories. :thinking:    
For example:

 - Constants, enums, literal types...
 - Data structures describing some aspects of the business logic, that can be used by both mutations and queries.
 - Various forms of "memory-only" computations.

Well... In my case, I find that in each Django app the `domain` package itself is a very good place to welcome these! :slight_smile: 

For this mini project, for example, I chose to have a single Python module (`apps.gin_scoring.domain.gin_rummy`)
to store some "business-logic-related" stuff that is specific to the Gin Rummy game :material-cards-playing:, 
and that are neither a mutation nor a query:
``` python
# file: src/apps/gin_scoring/domain/gin_rummy.py
from typing import Literal

# Possible outcomes of a Gin Rummy game: # (1)
GAME_OUTCOME = Literal["knock", "gin", "big_gin", "undercut", "draw"]


def calculate_round_score(*, game_outcome: GAME_OUTCOME, deadwood_value: int) -> int:
    # @link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_rummy#Knocking
    match game_outcome:
        case "draw":
            return 0
        case "knock":
            return deadwood_value
        case "gin":
            return 25 + deadwood_value
        case "big_gin":
            return 31 + deadwood_value
        case "undercut":
            return 15 + deadwood_value
        case _:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid game outcome value '{game_outcome}'")

``` 

1. More on that `Literal` type below :point_down:


We can see indeed that calculating the score of a round, depending on its outcome and the value of its _deadwood_,
is neither a mutation nor a query: it's just a standalone computation, that does not depend on anything
we would have in a database.

And the same goes for enumerating the possible outcomes of a Gin Rummy game.

!!! note "Literals or Enums?"
    To express the outcome of a Gin Rummy game I could of course have used a Python enum instead:
    ``` python
    @enum.unique
    class GameOutcome(enum.Enum):
        KNOCK = "knock" # or `enum.auto()`
        GIN = "gin"
        BIG_GIN = "big_gin"
        UNDERCUT = "undercut"
        DRAW = "draw"
    ```
    As for me, I must admit that I have no strict rules when I have to choose between one or another way to describe that 
    kind of data :person_shrugging: 

    I was mostly using Enums until a few years ago, but as I was using TypeScript more and more
    I realised that I really liked using [literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/literal-types.html) there -
    the TypeScript equivalent of that Python `Literal` would be:
    ```typescript
    export type GAME_OUTCOME = "knock" | "gin" | "big_gin" | "undercut" | "draw"
    ```

    I appreciate the concision of literals, and tend to use them when I have the feeling that having such "literal values" 
    spread in the code wouldn't cause any issue later on if I have to change their values :slight_smile:    
    Enums are certainly easier to handle in case of refactorings, but so far I've never come across a case where during a refactoring
    I regretted having opted for a literal rather than an Enum - fingers crossed, it won't be the case anytime soon! :smile: :fingers_crossed:

## And that's it! :slight_smile:

As we can see the pattern is very simple to implement, and its few principles are a very good guideline
for developers when they have to add some code.

 - **Is it code that creates, updates or deletes data in a database?**  
    :point_right: Let's create a new module in the `domain.mutations` package of the related Django app, 
    that will expose one single "kwargs-only" function - its name will start with a verb. 
 - **Is it code that reads data from a database?**  
    :point_right: Let's create a new module in the `domain.queries` package of the related Django app,
    that will expose one single "kwargs-only" function.
 - **Is it code that expresses the business logic but neither alters nor reads data from a database?**  
    :point_right: Let's put that in a module of the `domain` package of the related Django app.

The beauty of that pattern is that it really scales very well, despite its simplicity: my former teams and I used it for years 
on ever-growing code bases without having ever faced a case where the pattern would show a limitation. :ok_hand:
