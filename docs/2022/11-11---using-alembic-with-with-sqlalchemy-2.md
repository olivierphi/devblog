# Using Alembic with SQLAlchemy 2

!!! abstract
    With a quick experiment I wanted to check if the current _stable_ version of **Alembic** - the "database migrations"
    companion tool of the **SQLAlchemy** database abstraction layer and ORM - could be used with the
    brand new major version (still in Beta at the time of writing) of SQLAlchemy.

As someone who cannot code without type annotations, I find it quite exciting to see that the Python ecosystem seems to be going 
more and more towards _"strongly type-hinted"_ packages, the same way it's been happening in the JavaScript world with TypeScript during
the last few years.

The upcoming major version of SQlAlchemy - quite a major tool, with its **60 millions downloads per month**! - is bringing
a very modern way to define Models, based on Python type hints.

I mean... look at this beauty!
```python
from typing import Annotated, Optional
from sqlalchemy import ForeignKey, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column, registry, relationship

str50 = Annotated[str, 50]


class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    registry = registry(
        type_annotation_map={
            str50: String(50),
        }
    )


# set up mapped_column() overrides, using whole column styles that are
# expected to be used in multiple places
intpk = Annotated[int, mapped_column(primary_key=True)]
user_fk = Annotated[int, mapped_column(ForeignKey("user_account.id"))]


class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user_account"

    id: Mapped[intpk] # âœ¨
    name: Mapped[str50] # âœ¨âœ¨
    fullname: Mapped[Optional[str]] # âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
    addresses: Mapped[list["Address"]] = relationship( # âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
        back_populates="user"
    ) 


class Address(Base):
    __tablename__ = "address"

    id: Mapped[intpk]
    email_address: Mapped[str50]
    user_id: Mapped[user_fk]
    user: Mapped["User"] = relationship(back_populates="addresses")
```

This code comes from the _very_ complete :books: changelog of the 2.0.0b3 Beta release:  

 - https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/whatsnew_20.html

## Database migrations management

As I can't live my backend developer life without a database migrations machinery 
(whether it's Django's excellent one, or before that Doctrine's, Rails', or Zend Framework's also great migrations systems),
I _cannot_ give a try to that version of SQLAlchemy without migrations. :sweat_smile: 

My issue was that even if I can start fiddling with SQLAlchemy 2 right away by installing the
Beta release, there is nothing on its migration companion ([Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/), 
also maintained by the folks behind SQLAlchemy) saying that it does work with this new version :thinking:

But who knows, maybe the "metadata" part of the SQLAlchemy API hasn't been changed so much with this 2.0 version - 
which would allow me to use the current stable version of Alembic with this shiny new release
of SQLAlchemy?  
Let's give it a shot! :fingers_crossed:

## Setting up a _"SQLAlchemy 2 + Alembic"_ test project

#### Common Python project setup

As always, I'll start with a new virtual environment, with an up-to-date version of Pip
and Poetry ready to serve:
```bash
$ mkdir sqlalchemy2-test
$ cd sqlalchemy2-test/
$ pyenv shell 3.10.4
$ python -m venv .venv
$ venv # my shell alias for `source .venv/bin/activate`
(.venv) $ pip install -U pip poetry
(.venv) $ poetry init
```

#### Installing and configuring SQLAlchemy & Alembic

Right, now let's install the Beta version of SQLAlchemy 2, as well as the stable version of Alembic:
```bash
(.venv) $ poetry add SQLAlchemy==2.0.0b3 alembic
```

Then, according to [Alembic's tutorial](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) we have to run an initalisation command:
```bash
(.venv) $ alembic init alembic
```

This command creates a `alembic.ini` at the root of my project, as well as an `alembic/` folder
at the same level, with some files pretty much ready to be used as is.  

For demonstration purpose I'll just create a `models.py` file at the root of my project,
and copy-paste the nicely type-hinted User and Address models from the changelog in that file.

```bash
sqlalchemy2-test/
â”œâ”€â”€ alembic/
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ versions/
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ env.py # Alembic Python config - using data from the INI file
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ README
â”‚     â””â”€â”€ script.py.mako # the template for generated migrations
â”œâ”€â”€ alembic.ini # Alembic INI config
â”œâ”€â”€ models.py # my SQLAlchemy models definition
â”œâ”€â”€ poetry.lock
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml
```


The next step is to tell Alembic where the SQLAlchemy metadata are.  
This is done in the `alembic/env.py` file:
``` {.python hl_lines="5-6"}
# file: alembic/env.py

# add your model's MetaData object here
# for 'autogenerate' support
from models import Base
target_metadata = Base.metadata # and that's it! ðŸ™‚
```

##### Hard-coded database URL in the INI file? Meh ðŸ˜„

I could have left the `alembic.ini` and the `alembic/env.py` files as is (that's where Alembic
gets its settings from), however I noticed that **the URL of the database is hard-coded
in the INI file** - which is something I'm not a big fan of.

``` {.ini hl_lines="9"}
# file: alembic.ini

# N.B. The generated file is nicely documented ðŸ‘Œ, but for the sake of brevity
# I'll strip the comments from this extract :-)

[alembic]
script_location = alembic
prepend_sys_path = .
sqlalchemy.url = driver://user:pass@localhost/dbname

[loggers]
; etc
```


In most modern Web projects the URL of the database we're interacting with comes from an environment variable 
(usually `DATABASE_URL`, but it can have any name really), so one can deploy their project on any number of environments 
and point to different databases on each of them, simply by setting the value of that variable.  
**I really want to be able to use a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, rather than relying on some hard-coded data in an INI file!**

But wait a  minute... :thinking:   
This `alembic/env.py` being **a plain Python file**, surely there must be a way for me to get the database URL injected 
from an environment variable, just by adding a tiny bit of Python logic? :fingers_crossed:

#### Using an `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to set up the database

I'm not familiar at all with the content of that `alembic/env.py` file, but from what I understand
of if after having skimmed through it... :eyeglasses:   
It seems that the content of the INI file - where the hard-coded database URL is - is used in 2 locations:
``` {.python hl_lines="5 19"}
# file: alembic/env.py
... # various stuff here

def run_migrations_offline() -> None:
    url = config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")
    context.configure(
        url=url,
        target_metadata=target_metadata,
        literal_binds=True,
        dialect_opts={"paramstyle": "named"},
    )

    with context.begin_transaction():
        context.run_migrations()


def run_migrations_online() -> None:
    connectable = engine_from_config(
        config.get_section(config.config_ini_section),
        prefix="sqlalchemy.",
        poolclass=pool.NullPool,
    )

    with connectable.connect() as connection:
        context.configure(connection=connection, target_metadata=target_metadata)

        with context.begin_transaction():
            context.run_migrations()

... # various stuff there too
```

Ok, so in one place it seems that we extract the database URL directly from the INI config
(`url = config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")`), while in the other one we pass the whole config
to SQLAlchemy (`config.get_section(config.config_ini_section)`).

Let's see if I can inject the value of a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to replace the hard-coded one,
with the following changes (highlighted): 
``` {.python hl_lines="2 4 9 22-24 26"}
# file: alembic/env.py
import os

SQLALCHEMY_URL = os.environ.get("SQLALCHEMY_URL")

# And then, I can adapt the previous code:

def run_migrations_offline() -> None:
    url = SQLALCHEMY_URL or config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")
    context.configure(
        url=url,
        target_metadata=target_metadata,
        literal_binds=True,
        dialect_opts={"paramstyle": "named"},
    )

    with context.begin_transaction():
        context.run_migrations()


def run_migrations_online() -> None:
    ini_config = config.get_section(config.config_ini_section)
    if SQLALCHEMY_URL:
        ini_config["sqlalchemy.url"] = SQLALCHEMY_URL
    connectable = engine_from_config(
        ini_config,
        prefix="sqlalchemy.",
        poolclass=pool.NullPool,
    )

    with connectable.connect() as connection:
        context.configure(connection=connection, target_metadata=target_metadata)

        with context.begin_transaction():
            context.run_migrations()
```

And now, let's try to generate an automatic database migration, from the User and Address models
I've copy-pasted from the SQLAlchemy 2 changelog! :fingers_crossed:

#### Generating an automatic migration from the SQLAlchemy models

```bash
(.venv) $ SQLALCHEMY_URL=sqlite+pysqlite:///db.sqlite3
(.venv) $ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add Users and Address"
```

Hey, it seems to work!  
Now I have a `alembic/versions/694d8b4caa20_add_users_and_address.py` file:
```python
"""add Users and Address
Revision ID: 694d8b4caa20
Revises: 
Create Date: 2022-11-03 20:50:27.894030
"""
import sqlalchemy as sa
from alembic import op

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = "694d8b4caa20"
down_revision = None
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None


def upgrade() -> None:
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.create_table(
        "user_account",
        sa.Column("id", sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column("name", sa.String(length=30), nullable=False),
        sa.Column("fullname", sa.String(), nullable=True),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint("id"),
    )
    op.create_table(
        "address",
        sa.Column("id", sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column("email_address", sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column("user_id", sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(
            ["user_id"],
            ["user_account.id"],
        ),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint("id"),
    )
    # ### end Alembic commands ###


def downgrade() -> None:
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.drop_table("address")
    op.drop_table("user_account")
    # ### end Alembic commands ###
```

#### Applying the migrations

Last but not least... Let's try to apply that database migration!
```bash
(.venv) $ SQLALCHEMY_URL=sqlite+pysqlite:///db.sqlite3
(.venv) $ alembic upgrade head
```

I can see that I now have a `db.sqlite3` that doesn't seem empty...  
Let's open with a database editor:  
![content of "db.sqlite3"](/2022/images/11-11---fiddling-with-sqlalchemy-2-and-alembic/db.sqlite3.png)

Bingo! :tada:

Can I also revert the migration, and then re-apply it?
```bash
(.venv) $ alembic alembic downgrade -1 
# I can see in the database that the latest migration was indeed reverted! 
# Let's re-apply it:
(.venv) $ alembic upgrade head
# It works! ðŸ™‚
```

## Closing notes

With this quick experiment I was able to check that the current **stable** version of Alembic can well and truly
be used with the **new major version** of SQLAlchemy, which is neat. :ok_hand:

It's so nice to see major packages like SQLAlchemy opting for type-hinted code!  
As for me, I joined the world of Python _because_ type hints were starting to be a thing there - so seeing things like that really please me!

Exciting times! :slight_smile:
